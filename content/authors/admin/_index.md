When I think about my childhood, two things stand out; first, facing problems due to moving countries on multiple occasions and second, computers making life easy and fun for me and my family during and after the relocations.<br><br>I became interested in the computers when I was in the elementary school. At that time, the computer was still a big box and I was crazy about playing Crazy Taxi with my friends. But now, it has become a tool to better my worldly refuge by making things smooth and easy.<br><br>Fortunately, the wave of big data and analysis has become vogue by the time I have entered the job market and I truly believe this wave can help people like me fight their very own obstacles. It makes me feel astonished at how humongous amounts of data can be made use of in such benefiting ways. What first started as a novice learning took the form of a passion, a desire to decode and understand the technology to its core. Eventually paving my way to believing that I can be a leader, both malleable and ingenious. I am passionate about Data Analytics, Business Analytics, and Product Development, and I look forward to harnessing every opportunity to learn better.
